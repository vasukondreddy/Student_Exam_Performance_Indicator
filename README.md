### Student Exam Performance Indicator 

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project that predicts student performance based on various features. The project is built using essential machine learning concepts and tools, and follows a complete ML pipeline from data ingestion to model deployment.

##  Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze student-related data and predict exam performance. This can help in identifying students at risk and understanding key factors that influence academic success.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- Gender
- Race/Ethnicity
- Parental level of education
- Lunch type
- Test preparation course
- Scores in math, reading, and writing


## -> ðŸ› Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ Data preprocessing and analysis
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Model building, evaluation, and selection
- **MLflow / Pickle /** â€“ Model tracking and saving
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**



## -> Key Concepts Applied

-  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-  Feature Engineering & Encoding
-  Train/Test Split
-  Model Selection (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
-  Hyperparameter Tuning
-  Evaluation Metrics (MAE, MSE, RÂ² Score)
-  Cross-validation
-  Model Saving and Reusability
-  Pipeline Creation 


## -> Results

-  **Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to visualize trends and correlations in the overall dataset 
-  **Achieved a model with high accuracy** in predicting student math exam scores  
-  **Identified key features** influencing math score performance *(e.g., reading and writing scores, test preparation, etc.)*
